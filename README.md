## Specs
* Check if the word chosen by the user is contained in the sentence entered by the user and return true. This will make sure that the program is finding the correct word in the sentence.
* Create a counter that will count the one instance of the chosen word specified in the previous spec. In this case it should count from 0 to 1. This will establish a method that can later be displayed to the user as per the objectives of the project.
* Have a foreach loop that will go through the entire sentence entered by the user and for each instance of the chosen word it will add 1 to the counter. This will create the final number that will be displayed to the user.
